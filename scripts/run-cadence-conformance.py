"""
Cross-binding cadence-partition conformance runner (ess-my4.3.6).

Backs the normative dependency-partition (cadence) contract in
CONFORMANCE_SPEC.md §5.7 (RFC semiring-faq-unified-ir §6.1) with an executable
harness. The partition pass classifies every node by the CADENCE at which its
value can change — const ⊏ discrete ⊏ continuous, class(node) = max over inputs
— and schedules each class into its own phase (folded artifact / per-event
handler / hot per-step tree). Two bindings that disagree on a node's class, on
the SET of materialization points, or on the bytes of a CONST-folded buffer
produce *different models*. This runner asserts they do not.

Two phases, one harness (mirrors run-determinism-conformance.py):

  * NOW (skeleton): `--self-test` runs an embedded REFERENCE classifier + folder
    over the static golden (tests/conformance/cadence/manifest.json) and the
    three §6.1 fixtures (tests/valid/cadence/*.esm), asserting that (a) the
    reference-derived class of every annotated node equals both the node's own
    `expect_cadence` assertion and the golden class summary; (b) the
    materialization frontier the reference derives (cadence drops across
    expression edges) matches the golden materialization-point set, and the
    hot-tree / per-event-handler emptiness matches; (c) the CONST-folded buffers
    the reference computes serialize byte-for-byte to the golden; and (d) the
    guards actually REJECT non-conforming input (negative controls: a wrong
    expect_cadence, a CONTINUOUS relational node, a from_faq cycle). Runs green
    before any partition-pass producer exists.

  * LATER (ess-my4.3.7 Julia partition pass + Rust/Python siblings): each binding
    ships a thin adapter registered via $EARTHSCI_CADENCE_ADAPTER_<BINDING> (or
    on PATH as earthsci-cadence-adapter-<binding>). The default run mode invokes
    each adapter on the same manifest and asserts its class map, materialization
    set, and CONST-folded buffers are identical to the golden and to each other.
    Populate `bindings_required` in the manifest as producers land.

See tests/conformance/cadence/README.md for the adapter contract.

Usage:
    python scripts/run-cadence-conformance.py --self-test
    python scripts/run-cadence-conformance.py \\
        --manifest tests/conformance/cadence/manifest.json \\
        --output  conformance-results/cadence/report.json \\
        [--bindings julia,rust,python]

Exit codes:
    0  self-test passed, or every required binding matched the golden
    1  a contract violation / mismatch (or self-test failed)
    2  manifest / config error (no run attempted)
