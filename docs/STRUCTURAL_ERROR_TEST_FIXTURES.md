# Structural Error Test Fixtures

This document describes the test fixtures for each structural validation error code defined in the ESM format specification. Each test case demonstrates a specific error condition with clear documentation of the triggering conditions.

## Error Code Coverage

The following structural error codes are covered by test fixtures in `/tests/invalid/`:

### 1. equation_count_mismatch

### 7. unresolved_scoped_ref

**Error Code**: `unresolved_scoped_ref`

- `unresolved_scoped_ref_missing_variable.esm` - Scoped reference to missing variable in existing system

**Triggering Conditions**:
- Scoped reference format "System.variable" where System doesn't exist
- Scoped reference where System exists but variable doesn't
- Complex nested scoped references that can't be resolved

### 8. invalid_discrete_param

**Error Code**: `invalid_discrete_param`

**Description**: Occurs when a discrete event references a parameter that is not actually declared as a parameter type.

**Test Fixtures**:
- `invalid_discrete_param.esm` - Discrete event references undefined parameter
- `invalid_discrete_param_not_parameter.esm` - Discrete event references state variable instead of parameter

**Triggering Conditions**:
- Discrete event `discrete_updates` references variable not declared as parameter
- Discrete event tries to update a state variable (should be parameter)
- Parameter referenced doesn't exist at all

### 9. null_reaction

**Error Code**: `null_reaction`

**Description**: Occurs when a reaction has both null substrates and null products (no reactants and no products).

**Test Fixtures**:
- `null_reaction.esm` - Reaction with both substrates and products as null
- `null_reaction_explicit_nulls.esm` - Explicit null values for substrates and products

**Triggering Conditions**:
- Reaction with `"substrates": null` and `"products": null`
- Reaction with empty or missing substrates and products arrays
- Invalid chemical reaction that doesn't consume or produce anything

### 10. missing_observed_expr

**Error Code**: `missing_observed_expr`

**Description**: Occurs when a variable is declared with type "observed" but is missing its required expression field.

**Test Fixtures**:
- `missing_observed_expr.esm` - Single observed variable without expression
- `missing_observed_expr_single.esm` - Another single case variant
- `missing_observed_expr_multiple.esm` - Multiple observed variables without expressions

### 11. event_var_undeclared

- `event_var_undeclared_affects.esm` - Undefined variable in event affects

**Triggering Conditions**:
- Event condition references undeclared variable

- Variables in event expressions not found in model variables

## Comprehensive Error Coverage

**Test Fixtures**:
- `multiple_errors_combined.esm` - File with multiple different error types
- `complete_error_coverage.esm` - Comprehensive test covering all error codes

These fixtures demonstrate multiple error conditions in a single file, useful for testing error reporting and ensuring validators can detect multiple issues simultaneously.

## Usage in Test Suites

### Python Tests
Located in `packages/esm_format/tests/test_validate_structural.py`, these tests load fixtures and verify that structural validation correctly identifies the expected error codes.

### Julia Tests
Located in `packages/ESMFormat.jl/test/structural_validation_test.jl`, these tests create programmatic examples of each error condition and verify the Julia implementation detects them.

### Rust Tests
Located in `packages/earthsci-toolkit/tests/structural_validation.rs`, these tests load the fixture files and verify the Rust implementation correctly identifies each error code.

### Expected Results
The `tests/invalid/expected_errors.json` file documents the exact expected validation results for each fixture, including:
- Error codes
- Error messages
- Error paths/locations
- Additional details for debugging

## Adding New Error Conditions

When adding new structural error codes:

1. Create test fixture file in `tests/invalid/`
2. Add expected results to `expected_errors.json`
3. Update test suites in Python, Julia, and Rust
4. Document the new error code in this file
5. Ensure all three implementations detect the new error consistently

## Testing Guidelines

- Each error code should have at least one clear, minimal test case
- Complex error conditions should have multiple variants showing different triggering scenarios
- Test fixtures should be realistic ESM files that could plausibly occur
- Error conditions should be isolated (one primary error per fixture, except for comprehensive tests)
- Expected error messages should be clear and actionable for users
