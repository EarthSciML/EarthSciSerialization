//! Data-provider consumption + cadence wiring — the refresh executor (bead
//! ess-14f.9 / RS-R1, plan `esio-consumer-rust-plan`; parent ess-14f).
//!
//! # What this module is
//!
//! A discrete-cadence Earth-system model forces its RHS with external fields a
//! data loader reads at a cadence — 6-hourly meteorology, boundary-condition
//! slices, time-varying emissions. PR-1 (ess-14f.7) gave the array RHS a *live
//! forcing buffer* ([`crate::simulate_array::ArrayCompiled::forcing_handle`]) the
//! integrator reads each step; PR-3 (ess-14f.8) let the array runtime consume a
//! coupled, flattened model. This module is the **refresh executor** between a
//! data provider and that buffer: it GETs CONST forcings once, REFRESHes DISCRETE
//! forcings at their cadence anchors, regrids each native field onto the sim
//! grid, and writes it into the forcing buffer.
//!
//! It is the ESS "**refresh callable + refresh_times**" surface a driver consumes
//! — explicitly *not* a solver. The segmented integration loop that calls it
//! lives in a user-owned driver / example harness (R-3, ess-14f.11), preserving
//! `library-exposes-rhs-not-solver`: this module exposes data + pure functions
//! ([`RefreshExecutor::refresh_times`], [`RefreshExecutor::refresh_at`]), never a
//! `solve`/`simulate`.
//!
//! # The provider contract, and why it is a trait
//!
//! The bytes are fetched by the EarthSciIO Rust `Provider` (bead `esio-9nb.7`,
//! data-providers plan §4.6): `materialize` (CONST, load once), `refresh(t)`
//! (DISCRETE, re-read at a cadence anchor; `None` if the record has not advanced),
//! `refresh_times` (the cadence anchors). EarthSciIO lives in a **separate
//! repo/crate that ESS does not link**; ESS instead depends on the
//! [`CadenceProvider`] **trait** here (dependency inversion), and a thin adapter
//! at the integration boundary wraps the real `Provider` to implement it. The
//! cross-rig mayor-gate on `esio-9nb.7` froze that signature so this trait
//! matches it.
//!
//! Time is the **f64 solver clock** — the cadence anchors `refresh_times` yields,
//! the same axis the diffsol driver integrates on. The upstream `Provider` takes
//! a wall-clock `DateTime<Utc>` in `refresh`; converting an f64 anchor to that
//! `DateTime` (via the loader's temporal epoch) is the adapter's concern, which
//! keeps ESS `chrono`-free and the driver f64-native.
//!
//! # CONST vs DISCRETE is declared, not guessed
//!
//! Which loader-fed variable is CONST and which is DISCRETE is **declared** by the
//! model: this module consumes the cadence pass
//! ([`crate::cadence::model_with_loaders`] + [`crate::cadence::seed_leaf`]). A
//! `data_ingest`-refresh variable whose source loader carries a `temporal` block
//! is DISCRETE (refreshes at the cadence); without one it is CONST (materialized
//! once, folds for the run). See [`classify_loader_bindings`].
//!
//! # No new engine primitive
//!
//! This is consumer/glue code: a provider *trait*, a regrid *seam*, and an
//! executor that drives them into the existing PR-1 buffer. No arrayop, no
//! scalarizer arm, no `VariableType` variant, no lift of the event/spatial
//! rejections — `declarative-bc-no-new-primitives` holds. The regrid itself stays
//! declarative in ESD (R-2 / ess-14f.10 *evaluates* the ESD rules; this module
//! only calls the [`Regrid`] seam).
