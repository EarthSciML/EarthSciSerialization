"""
Round-trip tests for §6 top-level `grids` schema support (gt-5kq3).

These tests verify the minimal viable round-trip path for the three
grid families (cartesian, unstructured, cubed_sphere) as laid out in
docs/rfcs/discretization.md §6. Fixtures live at repo-root
``tests/grids/*.esm`` and are shared across language bindings.
