"""End-to-end simulation of the worked scoped-reference-``ic`` fixture
``tests/valid/advection_reaction_loaded_ic_bc.esm`` through the Python NumPy
runner (:func:`earthsci_toolkit.simulation.simulate`), with every loaded field
injected through the data-**Provider** seam (DESIGN pde_simulation_pipeline §2).

Python counterpart of the Julia reference
``packages/EarthSciSerialization.jl/test/loaded_ic_bc_simulation_test.jl``.

What this exercises:
  * A REAL ``reaction_systems`` Chemistry (O3/NO/NO2, R1/R2) lowered to generic
    per-species ODEs, then SPATIALLY LIFTED onto the 4x2 lon/lat grid by
    ``operator_compose(Chemistry, Advection)`` + ``lifting:"pointwise"``. The
    flattener's pointwise lift (``_apply_pointwise_lift``) array-ifies the merged
    reaction+advection state ODEs so the reaction network runs per grid cell.
  * SCOPED-REFERENCE ``ic`` resolution (spec §11.4.1): ChemistryICs hosts
    ``ic(Chemistry.O3) ~ InitialConditions.O3_init`` (and NO, NO2). Each RHS is a
    LOADED FIELD served by the stub provider; the build-time fold seeds the
    provider [lon,lat] field into u0 cell-by-cell.
  * The loader→consumer ``variable_map`` bindings (spec §11.5): the wind field
    (``Meteorology.u_wind → Advection.u_wind``) and the per-species western
    inflow BCs (``BoundaryConditions.{O3,NO,NO2}_inflow → Advection.*_inflow``).

Provider injection (NOT raw arrays keyed by consumer name): a static stub
provider serves the fixture's DECLARED loader variables (keyed ``<Loader>.<var>``)
from the manifest ``inputs`` arrays. The reaction system's own inline ``tests``
block is the source of truth: this runner executes every assertion in it.
