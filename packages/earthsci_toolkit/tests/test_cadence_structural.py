"""
Structural-validation conformance for the cadence-partition fixtures (bead
ess-my4.3.6).

Every fixture under ``tests/valid/cadence/`` is the schema-valid, evaluator-free
form of one of the three RFC ``semiring-faq-unified-ir`` §6.1 dependency-
partition examples — ``mixed_stencil`` (all three cadence classes + both
frontier thresholds + the gather split), ``pure_topology`` (all CONST, empty hot
tree), and ``pure_pointwise`` (all CONTINUOUS, empty per-event handler). Each
carries an ``expect_cadence`` assertion on every meaningful node (the additive
ExpressionNode diagnostic field the partition pass checks against its derived
class).

This module locks in that the fixtures pass the full structural ``validate()``
verdict — not merely JSON-schema validation — so the additive ``expect_cadence``
field and the fixtures' shapes (an LHS-aggregate stencil, an algebraically-
assigned topology system, a pointwise continuous-``t`` forcing) never regress a
validator into a spurious ``equation_count_mismatch`` / ``undefined_variable``.
The cross-binding cadence CLASS / materialization-point / CONST-fold golden is
asserted separately by ``scripts/run-cadence-conformance.py --self-test``
(CONFORMANCE_SPEC.md §5.7); the Python binding does no partition-pass evaluation
yet (that lands with ess-my4.3.7's Julia/Rust/Python siblings).

RFC: ``docs/content/rfcs/semiring-faq-unified-ir.md`` §6.1; CONFORMANCE_SPEC.md §5.7.
