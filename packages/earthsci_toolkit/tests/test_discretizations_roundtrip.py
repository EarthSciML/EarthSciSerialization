"""
Round-trip tests for the §7 ``discretizations`` top-level schema.

Exercises the Python binding's parse + round-trip contract for each
shared discretization fixture at ``tests/discretizations/*.esm``. The
Python binding holds discretization entries opaquely as plain dicts
because stencil coefficients and applies_to patterns carry pattern-
variable strings that don't map onto the Expression coercion pipeline;
the round-trip contract is structural equivalence of the top-level
``discretizations`` subtree.
