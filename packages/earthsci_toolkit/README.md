## Simulation interface contract

The Python binding's `simulate()` is **not** a 0-D-only ODE solver. It is a
runner for the post-discretize canonical AST: spatial dimensions are folded
into array dimensions, and the only independent variable that remains at
simulate time is `t`. Once a system has been discretized, the binding
evaluates `arrayop`-rich ASTs end-to-end (reshape / transpose / concat /
broadcast / index / elementwise stencils), so PDEs, 2-D and 3-D grids, and
mixed ODE/algebraic systems are all in scope.

### What `simulate()` accepts

`simulate(file_or_flat, tspan=..., ...)` enforces a single rule on its input:

- `flat.independent_variables == ['t']`.

If any spatial independent variable is still present (`x`, `y`, `z`, or any
named axis other than `t`), `simulate()` raises `UnsupportedDimensionalityError`
(`simulation.py` — see the dimensionality guard around the
`UnsupportedDimensionalityError` raise site, ~line 1205).

This rejection is **not** a tier limit — it is an interface contract. The
contract is: if your system has a spatial axis, **discretize it first**.

### What "discretize" means here

Spatial discretization is performed by **EarthSciDiscretizations** (ESD), the
companion package that owns the rule engine. ESD takes a continuous-form
ESM document — equations using `grad`, `div`, `laplacian`, `flux_1d_ppm`,
and the rest of the spatial-operator vocabulary — and rewrites them into the
canonical post-discretize form:

- spatial operators are replaced with explicit stencils built from `arrayop`,
  `index`, and the elementwise op set;
- the spatial axis becomes an array dimension on each state variable;
- the only remaining independent variable is `t`.

The discretized document is what `simulate()` consumes. Inside the Python
binding, the array-op path is `_simulate_with_numpy` in
`simulation.py` (delegates to the NumPy AST interpreter in
`numpy_interpreter.py`). It walks the AST per cell against a flat state
vector and integrates with SciPy's `solve_ivp`. The interpreter has been
exercised at scales up to ~10⁶ cells.

> The `discretize` function exported from `earthsci_toolkit` itself
> (`from earthsci_toolkit import discretize`) handles only the RFC §12 DAE
> binding contract — algebraic-equation factoring, not spatial discretization.
> Spatial discretization is the ESD pass that runs **before** you call
> `simulate()`.

### What you do not do

- You do **not** write the PDE form (with `grad` / `div` / `laplacian`)
  directly into a fixture and call `simulate()` on it. That fails the
  guard.
- You do **not** need a separate "PDE backend" — the same `simulate()` entry
  point handles 0-D ODEs, mixed ODE/algebraic systems, and post-discretize
  PDEs of arbitrary dimensionality, because the post-discretize AST is
  uniform in shape regardless of the original spatial topology.

### Worked example: 1-D advection (post-discretize)

This example skips the ESD step (assume the document has already been run
through ESD) and shows the shape `simulate()` actually consumes. The model
is a 1-D diffusion stencil on a 10-cell grid where the spatial axis has
been folded into the array index of `u`:

```python
import json
from earthsci_toolkit import simulate
from earthsci_toolkit.parse import load

# Load a post-discretize PDE fixture. The 1-D spatial axis has been folded
# into the array dimension of u, so `independent_variables == ['t']`.
file = load("tests/fixtures/arrayop/03_1d_stencil_mass_conservation.esm")

# A delta spike at u[5]; everything else zero.
u0 = {f"u[{i}]": (1.0 if i == 5 else 0.0) for i in range(1, 11)}

result = simulate(
    file,
    tspan=(0.0, 0.5),
    initial_conditions=u0,
    method="RK45",
)

assert result.success
# result.vars contains "Diff1D.u[1]" .. "Diff1D.u[10]"; result.y is the
# trajectory, shape (n_vars, n_times). Mass should be conserved to interior
# tolerance: sum_i u[i](t) ≈ sum_i u[i](0) = 1.0.
```

Inside the fixture, the interior stencil is an `arrayop` over `i in 2..9`
with body `u[i-1] - 2*u[i] + u[i+1]`, plus scalar boundary equations for
`u[1]` and `u[10]`. That is the canonical post-discretize shape: every
spatial term is an explicit `arrayop`, no `grad` / `div` / `laplacian`
nodes survive. The full pipeline for a user-authored continuous PDE is:

```
.esm (continuous form, with grad/div/laplacian)
  → ESD discretize (rule engine rewrites spatial ops into arrayop stencils)
  → earthsci_toolkit.simulate()  (NumPy interpreter integrates with SciPy)
```

For more end-to-end discretized fixtures, see
`tests/fixtures/arrayop/` (1-D, 2-D, makearray, reshape, transpose,
concat, broadcast); `tests/test_arrayop_simulation.py` runs every
fixture's declared assertions through `simulate()` and is the conformance
contract for the array-op path.
