"""Grid accessor ABC and registry (ESS-side contract for ESD impls).

Per the 2026-04-22 grid-inversion decision, concrete grid-family
implementations live in EarthSciDiscretizations (ESD). ESS owns the
cross-binding interface contract; ESD implementations register
themselves against it at import time.

Signatures follow ``EarthSciDiscretizations/docs/GRIDS_API.md`` §7 (common
minimum grid-object fields) and the bead gt-6trd surface:

- ``cell_centers(i, j)`` → coordinates of cell (i, j)
- ``neighbors(cell)``    → adjacent cell identifiers
- ``metric_eval(name, i, j)`` → scalar metric field value at cell (i, j)

The registry keys on ``Grid.family`` (e.g. ``"cartesian"``,
``"cubed_sphere"``, ``"unstructured"``, ``"lat_lon"``, …). A factory
takes a parsed :class:`earthsci_toolkit.esm_types.Grid` and returns a
:class:`GridAccessor` bound to it.
