"""Build-time cadence-partition pass — the ESS ``structural_simplify`` analogue.

The dependency-partition pass (RFC ``semiring-faq-unified-ir`` §6.1, normative as
``CONFORMANCE_SPEC.md`` §5.7) is the build-phase analysis the
:mod:`earthsci_toolkit.numpy_interpreter` runs *before* it compiles a model's
hot per-step tree. It is the ESS analogue of ModelingToolkit's
``structural_simplify`` / observed-variable elimination, generalised from two
phases to three: it classifies **every node** by the *cadence* at which its
value can change and schedules each class into its own evaluation phase.

The cadence lattice
===================

Three classes form a total order ``const ⊏ discrete ⊏ continuous``:

==============  ===================================  =========================
class           changes                              evaluated
==============  ===================================  =========================
``const``       never                                once, folded into the artifact
``discrete``    only at discrete refresh events      at setup + on each event (per-event handler)
``continuous``  every step                            every RHS call (hot ``_Node`` tree)
==============  ===================================  =========================

The governing principle is that a node's class is a **pure function of the
data-dependency DAG** — ``class(node) = max`` (the lattice join) over its inputs'
classes — and is **never declared** by the author. The boundary between phases is
*derived*, not written into the file. The one new declaration the pass needs is
the leaf seed (the ``discrete`` variable kind); the optional ``expect_cadence``
annotation is a *checked assertion*, not a control input.

The gather rule (the rule that carries the design)
==================================================

For a gather ``index(A, e₁…eₖ)`` the index expressions are classified
**independently of the array**::

    class(index(A, e…)) = max( class(A), class(e₁), …, class(eₖ) )

so a stencil **splits** across phases: in ``index(u, index(nbr, i, k))`` the
inner neighbour-selection is ``const`` (topology) while the outer value load is
``continuous`` (it touches state ``u``). Operationally this is just ``max`` over
a node's children — no special case is needed; the split is a *consequence* of
classing the index sub-expressions as ordinary inputs.

The frontier cut and materialization points
============================================

Wherever a lower-cadence child feeds a higher-cadence parent, the maximal
lower-cadence sub-DAG below that edge is a **materialization point** — evaluated
in its phase, stored in a buffer, and referenced by the parent. With three
classes the cut fires at two thresholds: ``const → {discrete, continuous}`` folds
once into the artifact; ``discrete → continuous`` materialises into a per-event
buffer the hot path reads as a constant. A bare scalar-constant *leaf* feeding a
higher-cadence parent is **not** a materialization point — it inlines as a
literal (the pre-existing constant-fold). A whole equation whose RHS classifies
``const``/``discrete`` folds out of the hot path entirely — a top-level
**output buffer** (the observed-variable elimination that makes a pure-topology
rule's hot tree empty).

Topology FAQs (``distinct`` / ``skolem`` / ``rank``) fold via the build-time
relational engine (:mod:`earthsci_toolkit.relational`) in the ``const`` /
``discrete`` phase — *never* on the hot path.

The guards (checked, not hoped for)
===================================

1. **Acyclicity** — the ``≤ discrete`` sub-DAG (derived index set ``--from_faq->``
   node ``--ranges{from}->`` set) MUST be acyclic; a cycle is an implicit/
   iterative solve, out of scope. Rejected naming the cycle.
2. **No relational engine on the hot path** — a ``distinct`` / ``join`` /
   ``skolem`` / ``rank`` node that classifies ``continuous`` is rejected;
   state-dependent topology may not run per step in v1.
3. **Author assertion** — an ``expect_cadence`` annotation that disagrees with
   the derived class is an error (changes no semantics).

Conformance
===========

The classification is a compile-time property, so the cross-binding contract is
asserted **directly**: every binding MUST agree on each node's class, the *set*
of materialization points, and the **byte-identical** ``const``-folded buffers.
The Python producer is :mod:`earthsci_toolkit.cli.cadence_adapter`; the golden is
``tests/conformance/cadence/manifest.json`` and the runner
``scripts/run-cadence-conformance.py``. The §5.2 "minor formatting" tolerances do
**not** apply here.
