"""
grids_test.jl — Round-trip coverage for RFC §6 top-level `grids` (gt-5kq3).

These tests load the three canonical grids fixtures (cartesian_uniform,
unstructured_mpas, cubed_sphere_c48), re-serialize them, reload, and assert
the grids tree survives intact. Comparison is done against the raw JSON
tree (via JSON3 -> plain Dict) so key-ordering does not matter.
