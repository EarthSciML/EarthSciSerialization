# End-to-end + zero-alloc + cadence loader-refresh tests (ess-14f.6, JL-J3).
#
# JL-J1 (ess-14f.4) built `build_refresh_callback` — the `PresetTimeCallback`
# whose `affect!` samples a Provider, regrids, and writes the live forcing buffer
# in place. JL-J2 (ess-14f.5) built `ESDRegrid` — the reproject + per-method
# regrid applier that lands a provider's RAW native arrays on the sim grid. J3 is
# the INTEGRATION layer: it composes the library's exposed pieces — `build_evaluator`
# (the RHS), `build_refresh_callback` (the cadence callback + tstops), and an
# applier — into an honest `solve(prob, Tsit5(); callback, tstops)` over a loaded
# fixture, and asserts the cadence contract end to end.
#
# It is the Julia sibling of the Rust driver-level harness `segmented_refresh_solve`
# (ess-14f.11) and the Python e2e (ess-2fy). Julia's idiom differs: where the Rust
# driver runs a manual segment-by-segment loop, Julia hands the user a single
# `PresetTimeCallback` + tstops and runs ONE `solve` — the `affect!` fires the
# refresh at each cadence anchor. So this file is, like the Rust one, a documented
# integration test that exercises the consumer surface; it adds NO library API
# (`[[library-exposes-rhs-not-solver]]` holds — the solver is a test-only dep).
#
# Acceptance clauses (bead ess-14f.6) and where each is pinned:
#   • e2e refresh over a fixture — a coupled, discretized, non-PDE forced model is
#     LOADED from `fixtures/refresh/coupled_forced.esm`, wired to a Provider + an
#     applier, and integrated; the coupled closed form is matched to solver tol
#     (testset 1, and the full reproject+regrid path in testset 4).
#   • refresh-once-per-boundary — the Provider is sampled EXACTLY once per cadence
#     anchor and never between, even under many interior solver steps (testset 2;
#     also counted in testset 4).
#   • zero-alloc within a segment — the hot per-step RHS allocates nothing, before
#     AND after a real in-place refresh driven through the callback (testset 3).
#   • CONST/DISCRETE covered — a CONST provider contributes no tstops and is never
#     sampled (materialize-once); a DISCRETE provider refreshes at its anchors;
#     both appear in one scenario (testset 2), with CONST `scale` + DISCRETE `src`
#     also driving the e2e fixture (testset 1).
#
# Offline only: every Provider is an in-memory mock (no network, the CI contract).
