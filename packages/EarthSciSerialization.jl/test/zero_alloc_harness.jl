# Reusable zero-allocation harness for the tree-walk PDE RHS (ess-9cc).
#
# `build_evaluator` returns an in-place `f!(du, u, p, t)` that an ODE integrator
# calls every Runge–Kutta stage. For the runner to scale to large grids it must
# allocate NOTHING per call in steady state (after the first, compiling call) —
# otherwise every stage triggers GC pressure proportional to the grid size N.
#
# These helpers measure that property and are written to be reused by any future
# evaluator / vectorization work: pass any built `f!` (or a `Model` to build one)
# and assert the returned byte count is 0. They depend only on the built-in
# `@allocated`, so they add no test dependencies.

    rhs_alloc_bytes(f!, du, u0, p, t; warmup=3, samples=5) -> Int

Bytes allocated by a single steady-state `f!(du, u, p, t)` call. `f!` is invoked
`warmup` times first so every method/specialization is compiled and any one-shot
setup is paid, then the MINIMUM `@allocated` over `samples` measured calls is
returned. A genuinely non-allocating `f!` yields 0 on every sample; taking the
min discards incidental GC-safepoint accounting noise without ever masking a
real per-call allocation (a real allocation appears on every sample).
