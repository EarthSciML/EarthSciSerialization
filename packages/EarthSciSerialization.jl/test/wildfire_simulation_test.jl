# End-to-end simulation of the coupled wildfire–atmosphere–ocean fixture
# `tests/valid/wildfire_atmosphere_ocean.esm` through the Julia tree-walk runner
# (`EarthSciSerialization.simulate`).
#
# What this exercises (the whole flatten → build_evaluator → integrate pipeline
# for a MULTI-model coupled system):
#   * A REAL inline conservative REGRID inside OceanDynamics: the atmosphere-grid
#     sensible-heat flux (`flux_field` = [50,150,250,350] on 4 atmos cells) is
#     remapped onto the 3-cell ocean grid by overlap weights W[a,o]=A[a,o]/A_o
#     computed INLINE from cell geometry — bin-skolem broad phase (value
#     invention: `rg_src_bin`/`rg_tgt_bin`/`rg_pairs`) + fused
#     `polygon_intersection_area` narrow phase (esm-spec §8.6.1). The overlaps are
#     A=[[1,0,0],[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,.5,.5]], A_o=[2,1.5,.5], so
#     surface_heat_flux = Σ_a W[a,o]·flux_atmos[a] = [100, 850/3, 350] W/m^2
#     (conservative: Σ_o A_o·shf_o = Σ_a A_a·flux_a = 800).
#   * SPATIAL LIFTING of a whole-array declared-shape state ODE: D(SST) integrates
#     per ocean cell; `u_ocean` (a declared array state with an `ic` and no
#     D-equation) stays 0, so −u_ocean·grad(SST) vanishes and
#     SST(t) = 290 + t·surface_heat_flux/4.18e6 — LINEAR. Asserting SST(3600)
#     therefore validates the inline regrid weights indirectly but precisely.
#   * MULTI-MODEL coupling + flatten namespacing: the 5 models flatten into one
#     system; the atmosphere/fire 0-D scalar states (T, phi, fuel, winds) have
#     grad terms that correctly evaluate to 0 over a structurally-0-D field, so
#     they stay constant (T=288, phi=1, fuel=10) and inject no spurious dynamics.
#
# The OceanDynamics model's inline `tests` block is the source of truth for the
# trajectory; this runner executes every assertion in it, and additionally spot-
# checks the constant atmosphere/fire states.
