# Cross-binding conformance for the `expression` initial-condition type
# (bead ess-gjn, epic campfire-e2e ea-6sh).
#
# The shared golden under tests/valid/initial_conditions/ declares a domain-level
# `expression` initial condition: u's initial field is the existing expression
# AST psi(x) = 0.5 * (1 + tanh((x - 0.3) / 0.15)) evaluated over the spatial grid
# at t=0 (no new primitive). Python evaluates this end-to-end; Julia loads it as
# the shared contract — expression-IC evaluation in Julia is deferred per ess-gjn
# (Python-first scope). This test pins that Julia parses the golden, that the
# domain exposes the spatial grid, and that the initial condition carries the
# Expression AST, so the fixture is the lever the Julia evaluator builds against.
