# Conservative-regridding geometry kernel — Julia evaluator conformance.
#
# Bead ess-my4.4.3 (the Julia intersect_polygon kernel). RFC
# semiring-faq-unified-ir §8.1 / Appendix B.2; CONFORMANCE_SPEC.md §5.8. Mirrors
# the Python sibling ess-my4.4.4 so the two bindings agree on the SAME shared
# fixtures under the B.5 / §5.8.2 tolerance gate.
#
# Three layers are exercised:
#
#  1. intersect_polygon leaf — the planar Sutherland–Hodgman clip (dependency-free)
#     and the spherical clip via GeometryOps (Spherical() / ConvexConvex…). The
#     overlap of two unit-aligned squares is the unit square (area 1.0).
#  2. polygon_area as an ordinary sum_product FAQ over the derived clip-ring index
#     set — the shared planar fixture's actual AST evaluated through
#     build_evaluator, reusing the M1 aggregate machinery: with the tracer IC = 1,
#     d(tracer)/dt = −area·tracer = −1.0 confirms the FAQ area is exactly 1.0.
#  3. Spherical area (closed-form Van Oosterom–Strackee excess — needs no backend)
#     against known values (octant = π/2) and cross-checked against GeometryOps'
#     own Girard area for the same clipped ring; plus the B.5 tolerance gate.
