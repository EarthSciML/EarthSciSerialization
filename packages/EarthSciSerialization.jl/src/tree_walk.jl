"""
Tree-walk evaluator for discretized `.esm` models (gt-e8yw).

Compiles the canonical-form equations of a `Model` into a plain
`f!(du, u, p, t)` by walking the expression AST at every RHS call.
Bypasses ModelingToolkit entirely, so compile time is independent of
the system size — the path is intended for discretized PDEs whose
scalar count exceeds MTK's tearing/codegen ceiling.

Public API:

    build_evaluator(model::Model; kwargs...)
        → (f!, u0::Vector{Float64}, p::NamedTuple, tspan::Tuple{Float64,Float64},
           var_map::Dict{String,Int})

The returned tuple plugs straight into `ODEProblem(f!, u0, tspan, p)`.
`var_map` is the state-name → index lookup so callers can probe the
solution at specific variables.

Dict and EsmFile convenience entry points select a model by name (or
the single model, if the file carries only one).

Build a tree-walk ODE RHS evaluator for `model`.

All state variables must be scalar (shape === nothing) — the walker
assumes equations have already been scalarized by the discretize
pipeline. `arrayop` and `makearray` are supported in expression
position: scalar `arrayop` (empty `output_idx`) is expanded inline;
`index(arrayop(...), k...)` and `index(makearray(...), k...)` are
resolved at build time. Other array-typed ops (`broadcast`, `reshape`,
`transpose`, `concat`) raise `E_TREEWALK_UNSUPPORTED_OP`.

The returned `f!` closure reads `u`, the captured parameter vector
`p` (a NamedTuple keyed by parameter name), and `t`, and writes
time-derivatives into `du`. Observed variables are substituted into
RHS expressions at build time.

Keyword arguments:

* `initial_conditions::Dict{String,<:Real}` — override the default
  values in `model.variables` for specific state variables.
* `parameter_overrides::Dict{String,<:Real}` — override the default
  values for specific parameters.
* `tspan::Union{Nothing,Tuple{Real,Real}}` — explicit time span. If
  `nothing`, the first inline `tests` block's `time_span` is used; if
  the model has no tests, the null default `(0.0, 1.0)` is returned.
* `registered_functions::Dict{String,<:Function}` — handlers for
  `call` ops, keyed by `handler_id`.

# `_eval` below walks the raw `OpExpr` tree. That's correct but every
# op dispatch is an O(N) chain of String comparisons, and every
# VarExpr lookup does a Dict probe. For 4096-equation models the
# overhead dominates. `_compile` walks the expression once at build
# time and produces `_Node` trees where:
#
#   * op is a `Symbol` (pointer compare, not byte compare)
#   * state refs have their u-index baked in
#   * parameter refs have their `Val{sym}` type param baked in for
#     `getfield(p, Val)` — monomorphic NamedTuple access
#   * literals are pre-promoted to Float64
#   * registered-function handlers are looked up and captured once
#
# The compiled tree keeps semantics identical to walking `OpExpr`
# directly; `_eval` stays available for the unit-test helper which
# exercises the fallback path.

# ============================================================
# 3b. Common-subexpression elimination (ess-r7h) — eval-time memo, approach (a)
# ============================================================
#
# APPROACH (a) — eval-time memoization. The serialized IR and the canonical
# goldens are UNCHANGED: CSE only restructures how the *compiled* tree-walk
# evaluator computes a RHS, so results are numerically identical and the
# cross-binding PDE-sim conformance suite (ess-fmw, rhs_rtol=1e-9) is untouched
# by construction. Lives only in this Julia evaluator (the bead's named main
# beneficiary); other bindings need no change because numeric output is the same.
#
# KEY = `canonical_json(expr)` from canonicalize.jl — the existing,
# cross-binding-identical canonical form. Two subexpressions are "common" iff
# their canonical_json bytes are equal; keying on this is conformance-safe by
# construction (the same identity all five bindings already agree on). NO
# parallel canonicalizer is introduced — `canonical_json` IS the key.
#
# SHARING HANDLE = a value-number (Int cache slot) per distinct canonical key.
# This realizes the RFC §6.1 "node id as a DAG vertex" role in compiled space:
# a shared subexpression is named once and referenced from each use site by a
# `_NK_CACHED` leaf carrying that slot.
#
# DAG = the value-numbered data-dependency graph `_compile_cse` walks: children
# are compiled (and hoisted) before their parent, so a cached subexpression's
# slot is always lower than the slots referencing it — the prelude is therefore
# already topologically ordered. (cadence.jl's §5.7 graph is index-set cycle
# detection over raw JSON, not an expression-CSE DAG; the reuse here is of the
# *canonical identity*, not that specific pass.)
#
# EVALUATOR MEMO POINT = a per-`f!`-call scratch `cache::Vector{Float64}`. The
# prelude evaluates each distinct cached subexpression exactly ONCE per RHS call
# into `cache` (slot order); every occurrence then reads `cache[slot]` via
# `_NK_CACHED`. A subexpression occurring K times is thus evaluated once.
#
# BIT-EXACTNESS: a cached subexpression's definition is compiled from its
# original (first-seen) operand order — identical to what `_compile` emits
# inline today — so each occurrence reads back the exact bytes it would have
# computed. With no common subexpressions the prelude is empty and `_compile_cse`
# produces the identical `_Node` tree `_compile` would, so f! is unchanged for
# models with nothing to share.
#
# SCOPE — why CSE lives on the scalar tree-walk path, not the vectorized
# (ess-dhq) arrayop path. After ess-dhq, redundancy is removed at three layers:
#   * cross-grid-cell  — eliminated by whole-array kernels (one broadcast per
#                        structural cell group), so the same stencil is never
#                        re-walked per cell;
#   * intra-expression — eliminated at DISCRETIZE time: `discretize` canonicalizes
#                        each per-cell RHS (discretize.jl), and canonicalization
#                        already merges like additive/multiplicative terms. The
#                        2D-Laplacian interior body, for instance, lands as
#                        `16*(u[i-1,j]+u[i+1,j]+u[i,j-1]+u[i,j+1]+(-4*u[i,j]))`
#                        — every gather appears exactly once, nothing to share;
#   * cross-equation / intra-RHS-across-nonlinear-contexts — SURVIVES canonicalize
#                        (it normalizes one expression at a time, and does not
#                        combine `sin(a+b)` with `cos(a+b)` or a shared reaction
#                        flux `k*A*B` across several species balances). This is
#                        exactly the scalar/indexed-D tree-walk path, and it is
#                        where this CSE pass fires.
# Conformance PDE fixtures are pure single-field arrayops (n_scalar_entries==0)
# whose canonicalized templates carry no duplicate sub-node, so vectorized-path
# CSE would be a no-op on them. Cross-KERNEL sharing for COUPLED multi-field PDEs
# (one array subexpression reused across several arrayop equations) is a genuine
# future case — keyed structurally on the post-merge `_VecNode` rather than on
# `canonical_json`, with a per-call vector cache — and is tracked as a follow-up.

# Ops `_compile` handles specially (closed functions, array/aggregate producers,
# unresolved/illegal-in-RHS markers). CSE never hoists a node rooted at one of
# these and never rewrites their operands — such subtrees delegate to plain
# `_compile`. Everything else is the scalar arithmetic / comparison /
# transcendental family that `_compile` lowers to a plain `_NK_OP`, which is
# exactly what `_compile_cse` reconstructs, so hoisting those is sound.

# 4b. Vectorized array-kernel evaluator (ess-dhq)
# ============================================================
#
# DESIGN / FEASIBILITY GATE (ess-dhq acceptance criterion #1)
# -----------------------------------------------------------
# The scalar path above (`build_evaluator` + `_make_rhs`/`_eval_node`) compiles
# every discretized `arrayop`-derivative equation into N per-cell scalar `_Node`
# trees and evaluates them with an O(N) element loop. This section makes the
# per-timestep RHS of those array equations run as **whole-array kernels** whose
# compiled-node count is **independent of the grid size N**, with results
# numerically identical to the scalar runner.
#
# Strategy — TRANSPOSE the per-cell nodes, don't re-derive them.
#   The array-D branch of `build_evaluator` already produces, for each output
#   cell, a fully-resolved scalar `_Node` (ghost cells, const-array inlining,
#   semiring joins/filters, variable-valence reduction bounds — all handled at
#   build time, exactly as before). Instead of pushing N nodes into `rhs_list`,
#   we group those nodes by structural shape and *merge each group* into ONE
#   vectorized template (`_VecNode`) whose leaves carry per-cell vectors:
#       - `index(u, ·)`  STATE leaves whose slot varies per cell → `_VK_GATHER`
#                        (a `u[slots]` offset-slice / gather)
#       - const-array / ghost LITERAL leaves that vary    → `_VK_CONSTVEC`
#       - leaves constant across the group (param, t, a   → `_VK_PARAM/_TIME/
#         scalar state read, a shared literal)              _STATE/_LITERAL`,
#                                                            broadcast over lanes
#       - arithmetic / comparison / transcendental ops    → `_VK_OP` (broadcast)
#       - `_NK_CONTRACTION` reductions                     → `_VK_REDUCE`
#         (axis fold in the same order as the scalar path)
#       - closed `fn` ops                                  → `_VK_FN` (per-lane map)
#   Each merged template evaluates over its whole cell-axis with array ops, then
#   `du[out_slots] .= result` scatters the lane values back.
#
# Why this preserves numeric identity: the merge is a structural transpose of
# the *same* compiled per-cell nodes; a broadcast `f.(a, b)` applies the identical
# scalar `f` to lane j that the scalar node computed for cell j, and reductions
# fold in the same order. Elementwise ops are bit-identical; reductions match the
# scalar Tullio/loop order (≤ rounding, absorbed by the tests' tolerances).
#
# Why the kernel count is N-independent: cells that share a structural signature
# collapse into ONE template regardless of how many there are. Ghost boundaries,
# `makearray` BC regions, and distinct contraction valences each form their own
# (N-independent) group — this IS the "interior kernel + boundary kernels"
# decomposition. Only the embedded slot/value vectors grow with N; the number of
# compiled `_VecNode`s does not.
#
# Functions touched: `build_evaluator` (the `_is_arrayop_D_lhs` branch collects
# per-cell entries then calls `_vectorize_cell_entries`; renamed to
# `_build_evaluator_impl` with a thin `build_evaluator` wrapper so the
# N-independence property is introspectable), `_make_rhs` (drives both scalar
# entries and `_VecKernel`s). The scalar/indexed-D paths, `_resolve_indices`,
# `_compile`, and `_eval_node` are UNCHANGED — non-array equations keep their
# exact scalar evaluation.
#
# Node kinds confirmed vectorizable (no scalar fallback retained):
#   stencil arrayop ✓ (gather + broadcast)   contraction/reduction ✓ (axis fold)
#   integral ✓ (resolves to dx*Σcells = an OP/REDUCE tree, vectorized like any)
#   makearray BC regions ✓ (per-region structural groups)  ghost cells ✓ (gather
#   sentinel groups)  gather/indirect ✓ (STATE-slot gather)  broadcast coeffs ✓
#   (const-array → CONSTVEC).  Closed `fn` ops are a per-lane map — one kernel
#   node, N-independent — not a per-cell scalar evaluation strategy.

# `_VecNode` kinds. Disjoint from the scalar `_NK_*` space to keep dispatch clear.
const _VK_LITERAL  = UInt8(1)   # scalar literal, broadcast across lanes
const _VK_CONSTVEC = UInt8(2)   # per-cell constants (n.vals), length = #cells
const _VK_STATE    = UInt8(3)   # scalar u[idx], broadcast across lanes
const _VK_GATHER   = UInt8(4)   # u[slots] — offset-slice / gather over the axis
const _VK_PARAM    = UInt8(5)   # scalar p.<sym>, broadcast
const _VK_TIME     = UInt8(6)   # scalar t, broadcast
const _VK_OP       = UInt8(7)   # elementwise broadcast of op over child vectors
const _VK_REDUCE   = UInt8(8)   # contraction: axis fold over children (semiring)
const _VK_FN       = UInt8(9)   # closed-function map (interp.* = whole-array)

# Each node owns a preallocated `buf` (length = the kernel's lane count) into
# which `_eval_vec` writes its lane values IN PLACE at runtime, then returns it.
# This — together with the explicit `du` scatter in `f!` — is what keeps the RHS
# allocation-free (ess-9cc): the only Float64 arrays are these build-time `buf`s
# captured in the closure, none are allocated per call. CONSTVEC has no `buf` and
# is read straight from its stored `vals`. `fnargs`/`cvbufs` are scratch ONLY for
# the boxed all-scalar `fn` path (`datetime.*`): a reused closed-function argument
# vector and the child result buffers, so that map reuses one `Any[]` across lanes
# instead of building a fresh one per cell. The `interp.*` `fn` ops carry a typed
# `_Interp*Spec` in `handler` instead and run zero-box whole-array kernels
# (ess-wrh), leaving `fnargs`/`cvbufs` as shared empty sentinels; every non-`fn`
# node shares those sentinels too.
#
# Because the buffers are mutable shared state, an evaluator is NON-REENTRANT: a
# given `f!` must not run concurrently for one problem (the ODE integrator calls
# the RHS sequentially, so this holds). Concurrent/ensemble use needs one
# evaluator per task — the same constraint the preallocated MTK reference has.

# — a separate broadcast form would have to re-derive the fiddly clamp/NaN/on-knot
# corners and risk divergence; (b) `interp.*` tables are §9.2-capped at ≤1024 (and
# are usually tiny), so a materialized locate→gather→broadcast pass would add
