# GridAccessor interface (gt-hvl4).
#
# This file defines the *interface* that concrete grid impls must satisfy
# for ESS to query grid geometry during discretization, tree-walk, and
# codegen. Concrete per-family implementations live in the
# EarthSciDiscretizations (ESD) binding per the 2026-04-22 grid-inversion
# decision: ESS owns the trait + registration hook; ESD owns the concrete
# subtypes and registers them on package init.
#
# Signature surface (per EarthSciDiscretizations/docs/GRIDS_API.md):
#   cell_centers(g, idx...)            — cell-center coordinates
#   neighbors(g, cell)                 — adjacent cells
#   metric_eval(g, name, idx...)       — named metric field (dx, dy, area, …)
#
# Index shape is family-dependent:
#   rectilinear 2D:     idx = (i, j)         cell = (i, j)
#   rectilinear 3D:     idx = (i, j, k)      cell = (i, j, k)
#   block_structured:   idx = (panel, i, j)  cell = (panel, i, j)
#   unstructured:       idx = (cell_id,)     cell = cell_id
#
# Options keys are snake_case on the wire (GRIDS_API.md §2.2); this file
# only defines the accessor surface, not the generator surface.

    GridAccessor

Abstract supertype for grid-accessor types. Concrete subtypes live in the
ESD (EarthSciDiscretizations) binding and register themselves via
[`register_grid_accessor!`](@ref).

Concrete `T <: GridAccessor` must implement:

- [`cell_centers`](@ref)`(g::T, idx...)` — cell-center coordinate tuple
- [`neighbors`](@ref)`(g::T, cell)` — iterable of adjacent cells
- [`metric_eval`](@ref)`(g::T, name::AbstractString, idx...)` — metric field value
"""

Thrown by the default (unimplemented) generic stubs and by
[`grid_accessor_factory`](@ref) / [`make_grid_accessor`](@ref) when a
family has no registered factory.

throw [`GridAccessorError`](@ref) for unknown names.

Register `factory` as the constructor for grid family `family`. `factory`

is the RFC §6 grid dict (e.g. `EsmFile.grids["g1"].data`).
