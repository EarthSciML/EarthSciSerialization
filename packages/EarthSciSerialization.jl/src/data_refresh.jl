# Discrete-cadence loader refresh — the ESS-Julia consumer surface (ess-14f.4,
# JL-J1). Plan: mayor-dir esio-consumer-julia-plan-2026-06-26.md §1.
#
# The companion to the JL-J0 engine touch (`param_arrays` / `_NK_PARAM_GATHER`,
# ess-14f.3). J0 made a forcing buffer readable LIVE by the RHS: a dense
# `Array{Float64}` bound through `build_evaluator(...; param_arrays=...)` is
# captured BY REFERENCE, so an in-place `buf .= …` shows through to `f!` with
# zero reallocation. J1 builds the thing that DOES that in-place write at the
# right times: a `PresetTimeCallback` whose `affect!` pulls fresh native arrays
# from a data Provider, regrids them, and writes them into the SAME buffer
# objects — once per cadence boundary, never on the hot per-step path.
#
# Principle `[[library-exposes-rhs-not-solver]]`: ESS returns the *pieces*
# (`build_refresh_callback -> (cb, tstops)`); the USER attaches them to their own
# `ODEProblem`/`solve`. ESS ships no `solve`, no `ODEProblem`, no solver. The
# callback constructor itself lives in a package extension gated on
# `DiffEqCallbacks` + `SciMLBase` (see ext/EarthSciSerializationDataRefreshExt.jl)
# so the base library never pulls a solver-adjacent stack into `[deps]`.
#
# This file (core) owns three decoupled seams; concrete implementations live
# outside ESS, exactly like the GridAccessor / AbstractGrid traits:
#
#   1. the Provider protocol  — `provider_refresh_times` / `provider_is_const` /
#      `provider_sample`. Satisfied by the EarthSciIO Julia Provider
#      (esio-9nb.5) via a thin adapter, or by a mock in tests. ESS never imports
#      EarthSciIO; it calls these generics, which the data binding fills in.
#   2. the RegridApplier seam — `apply_regrid!`. The native→sim-grid transform.
#      The conservative/bspline ESD-rule applier is JL-J2 (ess-14f.5); the
#      built-in `IdentityRegrid` here is the no-op passthrough used when the
#      native grid already is the sim grid (and in J1's own tests).
#   3. `RefreshBuffers` — the registry of live forcing buffers, the SAME dense
#      `Array{Float64}` objects passed to `build_evaluator`'s `param_arrays`.

# A "provider" is any object that supplies a loader's native-grid arrays on the

#     ESS.provider_sample(p::EarthSciIO.Provider, t)     = EarthSciIO.refresh(p, t)

# (`provider_is_const` then comes free from the default below). The provider's
# `refresh_times`/`refresh` already speak `Float64` seconds on the SAME axis as

    build_refresh_callback(model::Model; providers, buffers, regrid = IdentityRegrid())
        -> (cb, tstops::Vector{Float64})

Build the discrete-cadence loader-refresh callback for `model` and its tstops,
WITHOUT embedding a solver (`[[library-exposes-rhs-not-solver]]`). The caller
attaches both to their own problem:

```julia
forcing = Dict("wind" => zeros(nx, ny))
f!, u0, p, tspan, _ = build_evaluator(model; param_arrays = forcing, …)
cb, tstops = build_refresh_callback(model;
    providers = Dict("wind" => wind_provider),   # var name => data Provider
    buffers   = RefreshBuffers(forcing),         # same array objects as param_arrays
    regrid    = IdentityRegrid())                # or the JL-J2 ESD-rule applier
prob = ODEProblem(f!, u0, tspan, p)              # USER's solver call
sol  = solve(prob, Tsit5(); callback = cb, tstops = tstops)
```

`providers` maps each forcing variable to a data provider (the
[`provider_refresh_times`](@ref) / [`provider_is_const`](@ref) /
[`provider_sample`](@ref) protocol). Several variables may share one provider
object; it is then sampled once per cadence boundary.

* **DISCRETE** providers (non-empty `provider_refresh_times`) are refreshed at
  each anchor: `affect!` samples, regrids, and writes the buffer in place, then
  calls `u_modified!(integrator, false)` so the integrator treats it as a
  parameter-only update (no trajectory re-init). Dependent/observed variables
  need no separate refresh — they are RHS expressions over the buffers, so they
  recompute automatically on the next step.
* **CONST** providers ([`provider_is_const`](@ref)) are materialized once into
  `const_arrays` at `build_evaluator` time; they contribute no tstops and are
  absent from the callback.

`cb` is a `PresetTimeCallback`; `tstops` is the sorted, de-duplicated union of
the DISCRETE providers' refresh times. Returns an empty-tstops no-op callback
when every provider is CONST.

Requires `DiffEqCallbacks` and `SciMLBase` to be loaded (the constructor is a
package extension); calling it without them throws [`RefreshError`](@ref).
