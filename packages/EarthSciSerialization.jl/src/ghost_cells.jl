# Trait-generic ghost-cell gathering (esm-dlz).
#
# Ports EarthSciDiscretizations/src/ghost_cells.jl from its CubedSphere-specific
# form (which reads PANEL_CONNECTIVITY + rotation_matrices and branches
# per-direction over `(6, ni+2Ng, nj+2Ng)` panel arrays) into a form that only
# calls `neighbor_indices(grid, axis, ±g)`. The output layout is flat-first: for
# a D-axis grid with halo width `Ng` the extended tensor has shape
# `(N_cells, 2Ng+1, …, 2Ng+1)` with one trailing `(2Ng+1,)` dimension per axis,
# so `ext[c, g1+Ng+1, …, gD+Ng+1]` is the value at the cell reached by stepping
# `g1` cells along `axes[1]`, `g2` along `axes[2]`, … from cell `c`.
#
# Corner cells (e.g. `(gi, gj) = (+Ng, +Ng)` on a cubed-sphere that crosses two
# panel edges) are resolved via composition of `neighbor_indices` calls — axes
# are applied one at a time, so a cubed-sphere panel-corner fill emerges from
# the grid impl's `neighbor_indices(..., axis, ±g)` returning a valid flat index
# after each crossing. No extra trait method is required for scalar ghosts.
#
# The vector-field variant (`extend_with_ghosts_vector`) applies a rotation to
# each `(u1, u2)` pair before storing; the rotation tensor is supplied by the
# caller because ESS does not (yet) own a trait method for ghost-face rotation
# matrices. Adding `ghost_rotation(grid, Ng)` as a Tier-M extension is tracked
# as a follow-up RFC addendum (see module docstring in `abstract_grid.jl`).

    extend_with_ghosts(u, grid::AbstractGrid; Ng::Int=1, axes=axis_names(grid))
        -> Array

Gather ghost values of the flat scalar field `u` (length `n_cells(grid)`) into
an extended tensor shaped `(N_cells, 2Ng+1, …, 2Ng+1)` with one trailing
`(2Ng+1,)` dimension per element of `axes`. `ext[c, g_1+Ng+1, …, g_D+Ng+1]` is
the value of `u` at the cell reached by stepping `g_1` cells along `axes[1]`,
`g_2` along `axes[2]`, … from cell `c`. The center column
`(g_1, …, g_D) = (0, …, 0)` equals `u[c]`.

Boundary-crossing connectivity (panel crossings on cubed-sphere, periodic wrap,
etc.) is resolved inside the grid's `neighbor_indices`; ESS merely composes
them. `neighbor_indices` sentinels (`0`) are resolved by clamping to the source
cell, producing a well-defined extended tensor even at open boundaries.

Uses only the Tier-C method [`neighbor_indices`](@ref); no new trait method
required.

Vector-field variant of [`extend_with_ghosts`](@ref) for a 2-component field
`(u1, u2)` on a 2D grid (`length(axes) == 2`). Each ghost value is rotated by
the provided per-position 2×2 matrix so the stored components are expressed in
the *query cell's* local basis — necessary for cubed-sphere panel crossings
and other curvilinear grids where the basis changes across panel edges.

The `rotation` argument has shape `(N_cells, 2Ng+1, 2Ng+1, 4)`, where
`rotation[c, g_ξ+Ng+1, g_η+Ng+1, :]` holds `(M11, M12, M21, M22)` — the rotation
that converts `(u1, u2)` at the source cell into the basis of cell `c` at the
ghost position `(g_ξ, g_η)`. The caller precomputes this tensor from the
grid impl; ESS applies it.

The center position `(g_ξ, g_η) = (0, 0)` should be identity (`M11=M22=1`,
`M12=M21=0`); we do not enforce this so that callers can also use this routine
to apply an arbitrary per-cell tensor transform to a ghost extension.

Adding a trait method `ghost_rotation(grid, Ng)` that returns this tensor is a
planned Tier-M extension (follow-up RFC addendum); see the bead description
of `esm-dlz`.
