    EarthSciSerializationDataRefreshExt

The discrete-cadence loader-refresh callback constructor (ess-14f.4, JL-J1),
loaded automatically when both `DiffEqCallbacks` and `SciMLBase` are in the
session. It supplies the one method the core `build_refresh_callback` generic is
missing: the body that builds a `PresetTimeCallback` whose `affect!` refreshes
the live forcing buffers (`param_arrays` / `_NK_PARAM_GATHER`, ess-14f.3).

Kept out of the base package per `[[library-exposes-rhs-not-solver]]` and R4 of
the plan (mayor-dir esio-consumer-julia-plan-2026-06-26.md §6): returning a
`PresetTimeCallback` needs `DiffEqCallbacks`, and `u_modified!` needs
`SciMLBase` — both solver-adjacent, so they stay `weakdeps`, mirroring the
existing `MTKExt` / `CatalystExt` pattern. Without them loaded, the core
fallback throws a `RefreshError` telling the user what to load.
