## Expected Simulation Results

Each ESM file has a corresponding `*_results.json` file containing:

### Coupling Verification
- Verification that all coupling types are properly assembled
- System assembly verification (total variables, equations, conservation laws)
- Cross-system variable flow validation
- Mass and energy balance closure requirements

### Expected Numerical Results
- Temporal evolution (seasonal and diurnal cycles)
- Spatial patterns and gradients
- Event triggering and responses
- Process interactions and feedbacks

### Validation Requirements
- Tolerance specifications for different variable types
- Conservation law closure requirements
- Process coupling consistency tests
- Performance benchmarks for different simulation backends

## Testing Requirements by Language/Framework

### Julia + ModelingToolkit.jl
- Parse ESM → ODESystem with correct number of state variables and equations
- Parse coupling rules → CoupledSystem assembly
- Generate appropriate SymbolicContinuousCallback/SymbolicDiscreteCallback for events
- Simulate with appropriate solver (QNDF for stiff, Vern7 for non-stiff)
- Verify mass/energy conservation within specified tolerances
- Compare trajectories against expected results

### Python + SciPy
- Parse ESM → callable RHS function
- Generate Jacobian for stiff solvers (BDF method)
- Implement event detection and handling
- Verify conservation laws and flux calculations
- Cross-validate results with Julia MTK simulation
- Test operator composition by comparing component vs full system

### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Parse and validate ESM schema compliance
- Generate expression graphs for visualization
- Create coupling graph representation
- Export interactive editor formats
- Support parameter and initial condition editing

## Integration with Test Suite

These end-to-end fixtures should be integrated into the language-specific test suites:

1. **Schema Validation**: All ESM files must pass JSON schema validation
2. **Parsing Tests**: Each backend must successfully parse all ESM files
3. **Assembly Tests**: Verify correct coupling and system assembly
4. **Simulation Tests**: Run full simulations and validate against expected results
5. **Performance Tests**: Benchmark assembly and simulation times
6. **Cross-Validation**: Compare results between different backends (Julia vs Python)

## Usage Examples

### Julia Example
```julia
using EarthSciSerialization

# Load and parse the ESM file
esm = load_esm("coupled_atmospheric_system.esm")

# Convert to ModelingToolkit ODESystem
ode_sys = esm_to_odesystem(esm)

# Set up and solve the ODE problem
prob = ODEProblem(ode_sys, u0, tspan, p)
sol = solve(prob, QNDF())

# Validate against expected results
validate_simulation_results(sol, "coupled_atmospheric_system_results.json")
```

### Python Example
```python
import esm_format

# Load and parse the ESM file
esm = esm_format.load_esm("ocean_atmosphere_biogeochemistry.esm")

# Convert to callable function
rhs_func, jacobian = esm_format.to_scipy_function(esm)

# Solve with BDF method
from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp
sol = solve_ivp(rhs_func, t_span, y0, method='BDF', jac=jacobian)

# Validate results
esm_format.validate_results(sol, "ocean_atmosphere_biogeochemistry_results.json")
```

## Contributing

When adding new end-to-end test fixtures:

1. **Complete Coverage**: Ensure all 6 coupling types are represented
2. **Realistic Physics**: Use physically meaningful parameter values and equations
3. **Clear Documentation**: Provide detailed descriptions of system behavior
4. **Expected Results**: Include comprehensive expected results with tolerances
5. **Multiple Scales**: Cover different temporal and spatial scales
6. **Cross-Validation**: Design tests that can be validated across different backends

These fixtures provide the gold standard for validating complete Earth system model implementations in different programming languages and simulation frameworks.
